# Lost-Legacy-
Welcome to our fully functional first-person single-player game set in a lush jungle environment. This project encapsulates the key concepts and techniques we've discussed in our class, ranging from the implementation of gates/valves, obstacles, occlusions, and more.

Features that I contributed to:
Gameplay Mechanics: I utilized Playmaker, a finite state machine, to craft intuitive pseudo code for controlling player movement, wielding the machete, and orchestrating enemy AI behavior.

Enemy AI: The game features a comprehensive AI system for enemies, including patrol, chase, and attack states, making for a dynamic and challenging experience.

Interactive Elements: To enhance player immersion, we've incorporated collision/trigger events and affordances, adding depth and interactivity to the gaming environment.

Visual Appeal: In addition to the game's logic, we've contributed to the visual aesthetics by working on Substance Painter to create a captivating jungle environment.

User Interface: We've also designed a user-friendly interface that displays important information such as player health, lure availability, and winning/losing screens, ensuring a seamless gaming experience.

Here is a design document of Lost Legacy and at the end is a video demo. There is also a link which sends you to the game file to download. To play the game, simply download the link and import it into Unity!
