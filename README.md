GAM3100 Final


Fully functional first person single player game with lure, combat, and a jungle enviornment. This game covers every subject we talked about in class, such as the use of gates/valves, obsticles, occlusions, etc. 
I used playmaker (a finite state machine) to use sudo code in order to move the player, machette, and enemy AI.
For enemies, there are patrol, chase, and attacking states.
Other logic I introduced into the game include collision/trigger events and affordences.
Along with the logic in the game, I also helped my partners with substance painter in order to add to the enviornmental feel of the game, as well as including the UI for the player health, lure, and winning and loosing screens.

There is a video demo and the full project in Unity at the end of the document.
