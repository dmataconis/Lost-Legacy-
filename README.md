GAM3100 Final

Fully functional first person single player game with lure, combat, and a jungle enviornment.
I used playmaker (a finite state machine) to use sudo code in order to move the player, machette, and enemy AI.
For enemies, there are patrol, chase, and attacking states.
Along with the logic in the game, I also helped my partners with substance painter in order to add to the enviornmental feel of the game.
